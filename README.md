# kmeans

An application to calculate clusters for a set of points using the K-means method.

This is a Go version of a lab exercise from .


// points are read in from an input file; the file format and the example
// input files used are directly from the University of Texas at Austin
// CS380P online Parallel Systems course K-means clustering lab
// https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~rossbach/cs380p/index.html

## Build

Clone the repo and build from the root directory as usual for Go.

## Inspiration

The UT CS380P Parallel Systems class had 5 labs each solving a different embarrassingly parallelizable challenge using a different language or tool.

We solved clustering with K-Means using C++ and Cuda. (I don't have that repo public here in GitHub because it would serve as a cheat source for future students in the class.)

We also solved equivalence comparison for Binary Search Trees using Go.

I enjoyed Go a lot and decided to cross-solve K-Means with it as a fun exercise.
